🚀 **Weather App JavaScript Implementation** 🌦️

I recently built a simple yet powerful weather application using JavaScript that allows users to get real-time weather updates based on their geolocation or city search. Here’s a quick overview of the key features:

1. **Geolocation Fetching**: Automatically retrieves the user’s city using their IP address, enhancing user experience.
2. **Weather Data API Integration**: Utilizes the Weather API to fetch and display current weather conditions, forecasts, and additional data like wind speed and humidity.
3. **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a city name to fetch specific weather details, ensuring flexibility and accessibility.
4. **Responsive Design**: The app showcases current weather and a three-day forecast in an intuitive layout, making it easy to understand at a glance.
5. **Email Subscription**: Users can subscribe to updates with email validation to ensure correct input.
